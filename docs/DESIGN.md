# ProveIt - Design Documentation

This document outlines the design and architecture of the ProveIt system, a blockchain-based intellectual property verification solution.

## System Architecture

ProveIt consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contract**: Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to store and verify file hashes
2. **Web Interface**: A Vue.js application for user interaction
3. **Python Package**: A pip-installable package with CLI and library interfaces

```

      └────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Component Interaction Flow

1. User submits a file through one of the interfaces (web, CLI, or library)
2. The file is hashed locally using SHA-256
3. The hash is sent to the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain
4. The smart contract stores the hash with timestamp and owner information
5. For verification, the same process occurs, but the smart contract is queried instead

## Smart Contract Design

The smart contract is intentionally simple to minimize gas costs and attack surface:

```solidity
// ProveIt.sol - Simple, gas-optimized contract
contract ProveIt {
    struct Registration {
        address owner;
        uint256 timestamp;
        string metadata; // Optional, empty string by default
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => Registration) public registrations;
    
    event HashRegistered(bytes32 indexed hash, address indexed owner, uint256 timestamp);
    
    function register(bytes32 fileHash, string calldata metadata) external {
        require(registrations[fileHash].owner == address(0), "Already registered");
        registrations[fileHash] = Registration(msg.sender, block.timestamp, metadata);
        emit HashRegistered(fileHash, msg.sender, block.timestamp);
    }
    
    function verify(bytes32 fileHash) external view returns (Registration memory) {
        return registrations[fileHash];
    }
}
```

### Design Considerations

- **Gas Efficiency**: The contract uses minimal storage and operations to keep gas costs low
- **Simplicity**: Two core functions (register and verify) with straightforward logic
- **Metadata Support**: Optional metadata field for additional information
- **Events**: Emits events for off-chain tracking and indexing

## Web Interface Design

The web interface is built with Vue.js for its simplicity and performance:

### Key Components

1. **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface with client-side hashing
2. **Wallet Connection**: Integration with MetaMask, Rabby, and WalletConnect
3. **Registration Form**: Simple form for submitting file hashes with optional metadata
4. **Verification Display**: Clear presentation of verification results
5. **Certificate Generation**: PDF generation for proof of registration

### User Experience Considerations

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex blockchain concepts are introduced gradually
- **Clear Feedback**: Loading states and error messages for blockchain operations
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Offline Support**: File hashing works offline; transactions can be prepared offline

## Python Package Design

The Python package provides both a CLI and a library interface:

### Core Modules

1. **hash.py**: File hashing utilities
2. **blockchain.py**: Ethereum interaction via Web3.py
3. **certificate.py**: Certificate generation
4. **cli.py**: Command-line interface

### API Design

```python
class ProveIt:
    def __init__(self, network='mainnet'):
        self.connector = BlockchainConnector(network)
    
    def register_file(self, file_path, metadata=""):
        file_hash = hash_file(file_path)
        tx = self.connector.register(file_hash, metadata)
        return RegistrationResult(file_hash, tx)
    
    def verify_file(self, file_path):
        file_hash = hash_file(file_path)
        result = self.connector.verify(file_hash)
        return VerificationResult(file_hash, result)
```

### CLI Commands

```
proveit register <file_path> [--metadata=<metadata>] [--network=<network>]
proveit verify <file_path> [--network=<network>]
proveit serve [--port=<port>]
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Client-Side Hashing**: Files never leave the user's device
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduces attack surface from third-party code
4. **Smart Contract Simplicity**: Reduces potential for vulnerabilities

## Performance Considerations

1. **Chunked Hashing**: Large files are hashed in chunks to prevent UI freezing
2. **Lazy Loading**: Web interface components are loaded as needed
3. **Caching**: Verification results are cached for repeated checks

## Future Extensions

The system is designed to be extensible in several ways:

1. **Multi-Chain Support**: Architecture allows for adding support for other blockchains
2. **Enhanced Metadata**: The metadata field can be extended for more complex use cases
3. **Batch Operations**: Structure allows for adding batch registration in the future
4. **Integration APIs**: The modular design facilitates integration with other systems

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Testnet First**: Initial deployment to Ethereum testnet for testing
2. **L2 Solution**: Production deployment to an L2 solution like Polygon for lower gas costs
3. **Mainnet Option**: Optional deployment to Ethereum mainnet for users who prefer it

## Conclusion

The ProveIt system is designed with simplicity, security, and user experience as primary considerations. The architecture balances the need for blockchain-based verification with practical concerns like gas costs and ease of use.
